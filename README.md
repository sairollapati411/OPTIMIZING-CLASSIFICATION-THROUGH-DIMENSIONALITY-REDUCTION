# OPTIMIZING-CLASSIFICATION-THROUGH-DIMENSIONALITY-REDUCTION
Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE, streamline datasets by reducing redundant or irrelevant features, improving model performance and interpretability. By focusing on the most informative features, these methods enhance classification accuracy, reduce overfitting.

Problem Statement: Identified challenges in handling high-dimensional data affecting model performance and computational efficiency.

Feature Selection and Reduction: Applied dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), or t-SNE to extract meaningful features and eliminate redundancies.

Data Preprocessing: Conducted data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling to ensure compatibility with reduction methods.

Model Building: Developed and tested classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM) on both original and reduced datasets.

Evaluation: Compared model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score before and after dimensionality reduction.

Optimization: Tuned hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy and mitigate overfitting.

Insights and Impact: Demonstrated improved classification accuracy, faster model training, and better interpretability of results by focusing on the most significant features.
