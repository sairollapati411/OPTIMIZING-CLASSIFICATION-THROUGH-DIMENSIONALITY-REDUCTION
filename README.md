# OPTIMIZING-CLASSIFICATION-THROUGH-DIMENSIONALITY-REDUCTION
Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE, streamline datasets by reducing redundant or irrelevant features, improving model performance and interpretability. By focusing on the most informative features, these methods enhance classification accuracy, reduce overfitting.
